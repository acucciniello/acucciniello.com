## Introduction 

There is this popular self help mantra that is extremely popular right now.  It makes sleep out to be the enemy.  It usually goes something like: "Sleep? You Gotta be willing to give up sleep to be successful!" While this is only partially true, sleep is also extremely crucial for successful ventures.  Today I will explain why you need sleep!

## Short Term Sleep Loss


Sleep loss over the short term is alright.  When you have plenty on your plate such as a full time job, trying to build a business on side, then you have friends, family, and responsibilities it can be extremely hard to get everything you would like to get done in the day and get a full night of sleep.

In cases where you might have a special occasion, such as you are pushing for a new version of a product and you must hit a deadline, it is ok to lose a couple of hours of sleep for a bigger deadline.  Here you are sacrificing short term pain (being tired), for a longer term reward which in my opinion is definitely worth it.  Also losing a couple of hours of sleep in one night will not kill you, just drink a little bit of coffee to help you the next day, then push through.  Once you are done, go to sleep earlier the next night to catch up on sleep lost and be refreshed for the next day.  

This method is not sustainable.  You should attempt to go to bed most nights around the same time, and waking up around the same time, all while sleeping 8 hours. Let's look at how long term sleep loss can affect you.

## Long Term Sleep Loss

Now, when you forgo sleep for multiple nights in a row and now you are struggling to stay awake very moment of the day without a coffee in hand, some things start to happen.  

Your chances of getting into an accident increases (it is similar to driving drunk).  If you would not drive intoxicated, why would you drive when you are severely lacking sleep? 

You cannot pay attention, learn, concentrate and do problem solving.  If you are someone trying to create something new and revolutionary where you may have an impact on the world, you need to be good at all of those things.  In the end, if you trade hours of lost sleep to "get more work done" you will be hurting your future self from getting any work done.  Its that simple.

It can cause serious health problems, such as heart diseases, heart attack, stroke, diabetes.  It can kill your sex drive, make you depressed, gain weight, and increase the risk of death.  

So remind me again why are making it ok to give up sleep regularly? 
 
## Changing Your Mindset for Sleep

I hope that these negatives of lost sleep have already changed your mindset towards it, but if they have not, I will attempt to change it farther by telling you my mindset.  

It is an essential part of your day.  Allocate 8-9 hours for it.  Make sure you build you day around it and your work around it.  Do not let live tell you to go to sleep, cause if you do not prioritize it, you will end up prioritizing more fun things to do regularly and your body, life and goals will severely pay for it.


## Conclusion

I used to lose sleep all the time in order to do "more things".  In reality it allows to get less done all the time.  The only time this is ok is if it is for a short period of time and you try the next day to make up for it.
