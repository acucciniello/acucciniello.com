## Introduction 

A Hot Topic today is how can you increase your willpower.  Most people thing they are lacking willpower and that is the reason why they are not achieving their goals.  

The truth is, with added willpower or stronger willpower you could easily increase your ability to say no to things that are preventing you from achieving your goals and say yes to things that will bring you closer even when the choice is hard.  

I have found that willpower is like a muscle.  It is a resource that will keep growing that more your exert it, overtime it will adapt to the stress and become stronger.

Today, I will give you some physical challenges that you can do that would increase your willpower the more you do them.


## Cold Showers

If you are like most people (I actually hope you are not if you are reading this post), as soon as you get into the bathroom for a shower, you turn the knob to closer to the H sign and wait for it to heat up.  God forbid you get in when it is cold.

Taking cold showers has numerous benefits for your health, but you can be extremely painful to take. Almost always I do at least a little scream when I take one.  

It causes me to be so uncomfortable in a situation that you are usually supposed to be extremely comfortable in.  The ability to stay in this zone of no comfort and in the ice cold shower, as your body is freezing you will increase your willpower with each passing second.

HOW TO DO: Start off slowly, do one minute, and turn your knob a little to the left.  Each day add 5 seconds, and turn it slightly more to the left(Or which ever direction is cold).  Work Your Way up until the shower is at its coldest and you are doing it for at least 5 minutes.  


## Fasting

Another physical challenge that is very tough for most people in today's world is fasting.  People are told that eating every 2-3 hours is crucial, and with so many ways to get food (especially bad food), you can always be getting food these days.

Fasting is actually extremely good for you.  Not eating for a long time, especially when friends and family are eating delicious foods around you, can be extremely challenging.  Constantly saying no to the food and drink that come your way will greatly increase your will power over the long run.  

HOW TO DO: Start off with not eating or drinking anything that contains calories for 12 hours a day. Then once you get used to that time period, increase it by an hour.   Before you know it you will be able to do multiple day fasts (this is extremely challenging). 

 
## High Intensity Physical Exercise

The last thing we will use to gain some willpower is high intensity physical exercise.  I am not talking about just any weight lifting workout or going for a jog.  I am talking about doing sprints that leave you gasping for air or squatting weight that makes you scream and focus so intensely to get the set done. 

Staying present and focusing on the muscle contracting builds a huge mind muscle connection.  Pushing through the barrier of what you thought you could do (a smaller weight or less reps) and then pushing yourself past your boundaries increases your confidence and willpower to push yourself for the next time.

HOW TO DO:  This will vary based on your fitness level.  Have a tough workout that makes your muscles feel pain, pushing yourself past weight lifting limits or running times.  Anything that pushes you.  Then each successful work out after, push yourself even farther.  


## Conclusion

I have built my willpower up to the point it is currently at through this method.  It is a constant battle of doing things that you think you cannot do, or things outside of your comfort zone.  Then you tell yourself you can and do it.  It is that simple, but takes the foresight in the moment to be able to do.
