## Introduction 

Have you ever felt so defeated that you felt like you could not get back up and you wanted to quit?

This has happened to me, and I just want you to be aware of this fact - **if you give up, you will never get where you want to be**.  It is that simple.  The only way you can get there is by keep on working to get there.

Today, I am going to try and show you why you should keep going, and how you can help yourself to get there.

## Why

Here are some reasons why you should keep on going!

### Plan

So you got knocked down.  Now what? There is a reason you did not accomplish your goal.  It could have been because you have have not found the right plan, or you have not been executing on the right plan.  The failure is trying to teach you something.  If you do exactly as someone else does to get to the goal, it should theoretically work for you right?  I wish it was that easy.  Sometimes some people need to work harder than others to get there.

### Learning

You are learning a great skill: persistence.  Most people are not naturally persistent when they are born.  We need some hardship to teach us how to keep moving on when things are down.

### Separates You From Most People

It is a sign that you are doing something that most people are not.  Most people would have quit a *long* time ago.  You on the other hand are a warrior, you chose not to quit.  This puts you in an elite group of people that can look challenges in the eyes and show that they will not back down.

## How

Now you know why, how do we go about doing it?

### Remember Why

Plenty of times when I felt like giving up, I took a look back at WHY I started.  I was doing something for someone else, or for future well being.  Once I remembered that powerful reason why I started to begin with, I would quickly visualize exactly how it would feel to get that thing I wanted.  From there I would bounce right back to work.

### Work Harder

If there is something you are not doing yet, *do it*.  If there is something you are afraid of doing, *do it*.  If there is something you are unsure about just *do it* and learn from it.  If you are not doing something right, keep doing it until you learn how to do it right.  There is nothing that cannot be overcome with some hard work and persistence.

### Clear Your Head

You want to remove all the negative emotions from your head.  Plenty of times when failing, other negative thoughts can come along with it.  Negative thoughts attract other negative thoughts.  The best thing to do may be taking a quick break and doing something you enjoy to get your mind off the failure.  Then think about it again when you are in the happy mood.  Ask yourself, do you really want to be defeated by this? Do you want to get over this and achieve your goal? I think the answer will be pretty clear at that point.
