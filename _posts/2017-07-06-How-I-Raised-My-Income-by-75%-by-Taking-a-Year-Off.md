## Introduction

Hello All! I am going to decsribe my journey over my job searching process the past year and a half for those that are struggling in the job search themselves.  Never lose hope! Something better is always on the horizon.  So let's begin at the begining of my journey in late 2015.


## Journey

This all started because I wanted to learn web development and new technologies! That was my goal to get a position where I would be constantly learning and getting to play with new tech.

### Q4 2015

I had my 1st 2 phone interviews.  Boy was I unprepared! I got these interviews through referrals from friends.  I did not know much about web development, and my current position had nothing to do with web development but more applications development.

**Lesson Learned: Don't use referrals for positions unless you know you are qualified for a position. It looks poorly for you and the friend that helped you.** 

### Q1 2016

At this point, I finisdhed my first fullstack project.  Although I completed it from start to finsih there were plenty of knowledge gaps that I had that I needed to fill.

**Lesson Learned: Once you learn something, keep improving on it to become significantly better. Do not stop after the first time.**

### Q2 2016

At this point, I made the decision to leave the cushion and safety of my current engineering role, to dive in and absorb as much web development and new technology experience. At the end of this quarter, I was on my own. Time to dive in.

**Lesson Learned: Maybe have a better plan when leaving my job without the definite safety net.  Maybe I left too early.  Having a solid plan in place, and a good base of knowledge might have made this experience faster and easier.**

### Q3 2016

In the beggining of the quarter, I was adjusting to being completley on my own.  Productivity was not at its highest due to lack of details in my plan.  I knew were I wanted to go, but did not flesh it out completely.

This is where my learning really started happening.  I created my 1st Amazon echo skill, played around with unit testing, continous integration, refactoring, modularizing my code, and ultimately releasing a product that hundreds of people used.

**Lessons Learned: Projects really accelerated my learning here.  Never use tutorials or courses as a way to learn.  Spend as much time learning by doing as possible.**

### Q4 2016

So, I had set a goal to get a new position by the end of August 2016.  That day came and passed without a job.  Without many interviews either.  I knew at this point I had to up the ante.  It was at this point I created a blog, to teach others and solidify my learning.  I also started cold emailing engineers at companies to get interviews, and upped the amount of hours I spent coding. 

**Lessons Learned: There is always something you can do to improve your position.  It takes some self analyzing but you can always find something you are not doing, or doing correctly and change that.**

### Q1 2017

Another quarter goes by, with no new position.  This was definitely a bummer.  All of my friends and family (minus like 2 people) thought I had become a bum.  They thought I was simply "playing around on the computer all day."  Little did they know I was being more productive than I ever was cranking out code and writing blog posts.  

It was during this time my resume started looking nicer and was picking up some traction.  Due to my emailing and applying, I started getting alot more interviews.  For some reason, I was not getting passed the easiest part, the phone interviews. 

I did some mock interviews with my mentor, and he revealed that I was portraying my self in a non-confident light.  That was making interviewers think that I did not have the skillset for the position.  

**Lesson Learned: The way you present yourself is way more important than what you can actually do during the interview process.**

### Q2 2017

The interviews kept coming in.  Making adjustments in the way I was presenting myself, I was finally getting in person interviews.  In the month of April I had 4 in-person interviews alone.  This was progress, but I still was not receiving offers.

**Lessons Learned: Perception was key once again.  I focused on that.  Also persistence in my vision was also what allowed me to overcome all of these rejections and negativity from family and friends.**

### June 2017

The interviews were rolling in, I almost always had one.  I had one final interview that was going so well (or so I thought), but in the middle of the interview they told me that I was not qualified and they sent me home. This was a huge blowback.  I was counting on this one to pull through.  

After a little sadness, I came around the next day.  I pulled 4 interviews next week and ultimately got a job offer!

**Lessons Learned: At this point, I was doing everything I possibly could.  I was simply being tested to see if this is what I really wanted by testing my will and persistence.  After every negative event in life, there will always be a positive one.**

## Key Takeaways

### Going in the Front Door is Always the Hardest

### Create a Blog

### Contribute to Open Source

### Perception

### Marketing & Leveraging the Power of the Internet

### Hustle & Persistence

## Conclusion

There it is, my job search.  It inspired me to work harder than I have every worked before, absorb so much information, be extremely resourceful, and turned out everything worked out in my favor.

I hop you take these key takeways and learn from them (it could save you plenty of time rather than finding out the hard way.)
