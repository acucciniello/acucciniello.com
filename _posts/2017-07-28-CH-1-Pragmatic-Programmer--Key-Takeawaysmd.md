## Introduction

I am starting a series where I will talk about the key points from each chapter in the *Pragmatic Programmer*.  Chapter 1 is on the Philosophy of Being a Pragmatic Programmer and the mindset you want to have when being a developer.

## Take Responsibility

The first part of the mindset is to take responsibility for everything that happens. Whether it is something good or something bad.  If you worked on it, at least part of it has to be your fault.  So own up to it, and be proactive about fixing it by providing options and not complaining and pointing fingers.

## Broken Windows

What is a broken window you ask? It is the idea of something that causes a problem in your code, either now or it will cause a problem down the line.  I have done this way too many times, where I am developing code with a broken window and instead of fixing it I develop on top of it.  I can guarantee you that this is the wrong way to go and will cause you plenty of problems in the future.

 
## Look for Change and the Bigger Picture

There will always be something you can improve on as a developer and as a team.  So look for things to improve on and be eager to make changes.  Make the changes slow and persuade people with your actions rather than with your words. 

Always keep the bigger picture in mind. Ask yourself refocusing questions, such as *"Is this going to help me get to my end goal?"*

## Good Enough Software

When developing an application, it will never be perfect.  There are always enhancements that can be made, more features that can be added, and optimizations that can be added in. It is your job to build great software that matches what the requirements for the application are.  Set everything including the quality of the software up to the requirements so you know exactly what you are shooting for.

## Invest in Learning

This one is HUGE. The one thing that someone can not take from you is the skills that you have developed over the years of work you have put in.  In order to make yourself more valuable and become a better programmer you must always be eager to learn and contining to grow.  You want learn things regularly and have a diverse set of skills by trying plenty of technologies.  You want to minimize risk by learning some languages that are mainstream, but at the same time learn some new hot tech trends.  

## Communication 

This one is also extremely important.  You need to be able to communicate with others to get anything done.  It is as simple as that.  Improving your communication skills whether it be written, or spoken could make you a more productive and efficient programmer.  Some tips for becoming a better communicator are planning out what to say, catering your information to your audience, having a clean presentation, and listen to the people you are speaking too.

## Conclusion

Overall, there is much to learn from this chapter and getting the mindset of a Pragmatic Programmer.  Using these 6 ideas as part of the way you think can truly change the way you code and think about coding.
