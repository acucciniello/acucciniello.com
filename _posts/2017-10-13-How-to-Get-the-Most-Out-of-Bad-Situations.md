Have you ever felt like sometimes you have bad luck? Maybe bad things happen to you often.  Here is what I came to realize, that if bad things are happening to you, most of the time it is at least partially your fault.  Something you did led to that situation happening and you must find a way to prevent that bad situation again.  

Today I am going to show you how to look at a negative situation and be very happy that it happened to you, simply because of what you got out of it. As Napoleon Hill said: *"Every adversity, every failure, every heartache carries with it the seed of an equal or greater benefit."*

## Remove Emotions

The first step that you must take in this process when something bad happens to you is to remove your emotions from the situation.  When your emotions are in the way, you will not think 100% logically, which is what you will need to get there. 

Wait for things to cool down, watch a funny video, go have some fun with friends, do whatever you need to get your mind off the emotional problem and then come back here for the second step.

## Write Out the Situation

Now that you have removed the emotions, go back in and attempt to recall the situation in every detail to the best of your ability.  Write this all out.  As you are writing you will be able to notice things you may have done simply with you writing it, because you will be seeing it with a 3rd party perspective.  

## Analyze The Situation 

Now that you have the entire situation written out in front of you, you can analyze it.  A couple of things to look for here: are there things you did that may have caused an another person or thing in the situation to do something, maybe something someone else or a thing did that made you emotional and react in a different way.  Look for these trigger moments.

You want to check out these situations and find the true cause behind the problem.

## Learn from Mistakes

Once you noticed the things you might have done, take a learning moment that you can take away from this so it will never happen again.  This is the ultimate goal, we want to learn from these terrible situations so we reduce the amount of negative situations we end up facing

## Conclusion

Thank you for reading! That is how you get the most out of bad situations, you first need to cool down, write about the situation, analyze it, and learn from it.  When you learn from it, you reduce the chances of it happening again.
