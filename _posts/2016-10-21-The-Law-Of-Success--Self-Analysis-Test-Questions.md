## Background

So, I just finished *The Law of Success* by Napoleon Hill. It is a book that is split up into 16 lessons. Each lesson is a quality or an attribute of what a successful person embodies. At the end of the 16th and final lesson, he gives a Self Analysis question test for all of those who wish to know more about themselves, their strengths and weaknesses. I decided to take it and have learn plenty about myself that has never really been brought out into my conscious mind before this. It was all stuff I knew in the back of my head, but not stuff I focused on. I am firm believer in continously improving yourself every single day. This test will give you a great depiction of where you are today. If you know where you are today then you can pinpoint areas that need improvement and act on them accordingly. I hope this helps!

If you would like to learn about the 16 Lessons on the Law of Success here is a link to pick up a copy on Amazon: <a  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617201782/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1617201782&linkCode=as2&tag=acucciniello-20&linkId=fd6fa88a6007659d737f8bade57ebec1">The Law of Success In Sixteen Lessons by Napoleon Hill</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=acucciniello-20&l=am2&o=1&a=1617201782" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Quick Tip #1: Make sure you are being brutally honest with yourself. That is the only way you will get the most out of this.

Quick Tip #2: The author suggests to spend an entire day to answering these questions. That seems like a little much, it took me only a little over an hour to answer the questions and type them out.

Best of Luck!
